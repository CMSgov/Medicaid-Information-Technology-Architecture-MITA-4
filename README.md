# Medicaid-Information-Technology-Architecture-MITA-4-
The purpose of this repository is to introduce MITA 4.0 Framework to states and keep stakeholders abreast of the work being done by the MITA Governance Board (MGB).

MITA 4.0 will be the latest major release of MITA, a framework and an initiative to establish national guidelines for technologies, information, and processes that will enable a standard approach to Informational Technology (IT) implementations for state Medicaid Enterprise Systems. MITA is included in sub-regulatory guidance to ensure state Medicaid IT projects align with national-level program goals and best practices.
