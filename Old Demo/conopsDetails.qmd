# **Introduction**

The MITA Framework provides guidance to the State Medicaid Agency (SMA) as they seek to improve their business operations and supporting Information Technology (IT). Because of the range and complexities of business conducted by the SMA, models and diagrams show the transformation from the As-Is operations to the To-Be environment at a high level, and examples that show more detail in specific business processes.

States should develop a Concept of Operations (COO) and business workflows for the different business functions of the state to advance the alignment of the state's capability maturity with the MITA Maturity Model (MMM). The COO and business workflows should align to those provided by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) in support of Medicaid and Exchange business operations and requirements. States should work to streamline and standardize these operational approaches and business workflows to minimize customization demands on technology solutions and optimize business outcomes.

The objective of this section is to describe the Medicaid Enterprise from a business perspective, identify the primary external entities (e.g., providers, beneficiaries, other payers), their roles, and the information they exchange, and depict the primary business processes (e.g., Member Management, Provider Management) performed by the Medicaid Enterprise in support of its interactions with external entities.

There are two (2) views presented: the As-Is operations of the Medicaid Enterprise, and the To-Be environment of the Medicaid Enterprise. Two (2) types of diagrams support these descriptions:

- A **Context Diagram** showing the major external entities and the information they exchange with the Medicaid Enterprise in the As-Is operations and the To-Be environment.
- A **COO Diagram** that expands on the Context Diagram. It describes the business operations and stakeholders of the Medicaid Enterprise. There are As-Is operations and To-Be environment views.

Together, the Context Diagram and the COO Diagram show the transformation of the Medicaid Enterprise. The COO also describes the primary drivers that enable the transformation. These first descriptions are high level. Next, examples of selected business processes illustrate details of the transformation.

The following storyboard describes the flow of the COO with the Medicaid Enterprise as a subset of a national health information infrastructure.

- Current Medicaid operations include a number of business processes that support the SMA responsibilities and interface with its primary business partners (beneficiaries, providers, and other stakeholders). There are many deficiencies in the current operations:
	-  Administrative burden
	-  Time lags
	-  Labor intensive processes
	-  Lack of standardized, consistent, and complete data

![](_page_1_Picture_16.jpeg)

-  Redundant services and data collection
-  Lack of clinical information
-  Limited collaboration among the many entities that serve the population (e.g., Medicaid, Medicare, substance abuse, mental health, public health, and others)
- Future operations benefit from the vision of improvements attainable in the national health care delivery system supported by the advances of technology, the enforcement of standards, and the use of the Electronic Health Record (EHR).
- The Context Diagram illustrates the As-Is operations. The SMA exchanges primary information with its major partners, e.g., eligibility sources send eligibility information, providers submit claims, checks are "in the mail", and the SMA produces reports on a schedule "whether you want it or not".
- A companion To-Be Context Diagram shows a different future view. In the near future, notifications of new information, automatically sent to the appropriate receiver and triggered by entries into the patient's EHR, replace transactions (e.g., claims and eligibility requests).
- To illustrate the differences between the As-Is operations and the To-Be environment, tables show how the definition and the role of the primary entities (e.g., the SMA, provider, beneficiary, etc.) will change in response to the changes in the way the SMA will exchange information as well as the content of the communication.
- The MITA team examines today's COO, which includes stakeholders, IT support, policies and procedures, and traditional activities the SMA conducts.
- A narrative highlights the changes in the Medicaid Program with the Seven Standards and Conditions, which align with the MITA Missions and Goals. These principles provide the target of operations in the near future.
- To show the future transformation, the COO provides some examples of business improvements in operational scenarios. Several examples illustrate how to move from the As-Is operations to the To-Be environment.

## **As-Is – High Level Narrative**

Currently, the Medicaid Enterprise contains several primary entities whose relationships and information exchanges have evolved since Medicaid's inception in 1965 through the Title XIX of the Social Security Act. Major participants in the Medicaid Enterprise are: CMS, the SMA, sources of eligibility determination, providers, managed care organizations, beneficiaries, other agencies, and other payers. Title XIX of the Social Security Act created the national Medicaid Program to bring health care benefits to individuals meeting financial, age, and disability requirements. Federal funding matches state expenditures for approved benefits and administrative services. Each state, territory, and the District of Columbia (hereinafter referred to as the States) designate a single state agency to administer the program. The SMA pays providers, managed care organizations, benefit managers, and others to deliver a package of mandated and optional benefits to the covered population.

The primary influences on the Medicaid Enterprise are:

- Federal, state, and local legislation
- Federal and state health care initiatives
- Provider and consumer advocate demands
- Court orders
- Influence of the American health care delivery environment
- Funding
- Vendor solutions

The Medicaid Enterprise is part of a loosely structured local and national health care infrastructure with which it shares providers, consumers, treatment protocols, data standards, health improvement objectives, public health reporting, and information.

Health care represents a significant percentage of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the United States; yet this business sector lags behind all other leading economic cost centers in the adoption of technology to improve its outcomes and manage its expenditures.

# **To-Be – High Level Narrative**

The MITA Framework defines a future in which health care stakeholders (e.g., policy makers, tax payers, consumers, providers, public health and oversight agencies, and health plans) participate in achieving the objectives of improving health outcomes of the population served by providing the right services at the right time at the right cost in a timely and accountable way. Stakeholders are able to apply for health assistance and receive an eligibility determination in real-time. Stakeholders benefit from improvements in information sharing and exchange that enable caregivers, payers, and patients to view appropriate clinical information without delay and use this information to make appropriate health care decisions. Providers and payers are able to focus on their primary functions of care giving, benefit plan monitoring, and evaluation as most of the administrative burden of information capture, processing, and reporting are obsolete with the usage of direct messaging between data exchange partners.

Realizing these benefits requires an underlying infrastructure that can support the use of patient-focused electronic health information, and information that goes beyond the limitations of a specific provider, health plan or delivery system. It also includes the process of sharing health-related information in a secure manner, protecting the confidentiality of the information. The building blocks associated with this infrastructure are the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) and EHR for health care professionals, Personal Health Record (PHR) for individuals, and Health Information Exchange (HIE) used to tie the infrastructure together. A Regional Health Information Organization (RHIO) organizes all of these components into a local infrastructure.

Aggressive federal initiatives to improve the quality of care as well as streamline the administration of health services are influencing the Health Care and Health Insurance industries. Relevant federal regulations such as Health Insurance Portability & Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996, American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) of 2009, Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (CHIPRA) of 2009, and the

Affordable Care Act of 2010, (among others) are changing the administration of health care and insurance. It is vital that the MITA Framework supports the changes in securing information, sharing resources and enhancing the stakeholder's experience.

# **Context Diagram Medicaid Operations**

The Medicaid Enterprise Context Diagram presents a conceptual view of the external entities with which the SMA interacts. External entities are conceptual groupings of individuals or organizations based on the role the entities have with the Medicaid Enterprise. The Context Diagram shows only entities with significant and unique roles that interact with the enterprise. The Context Diagram tightly links to the Business Process Model (BPM) as the diagram depicts the primary actors and activities, which a Medicaid Enterprise includes. The diagram associates exchange (i.e., input and output) of information with external entities to one or more processes within the BPM.

### **As-Is Context Diagram**

The Medicaid Enterprise As-Is diagram, **[Figure A-1](#page-4-0)**, illustrates the primary entities (e.g., providers, beneficiaries, CMS, and other payers) and gives a high-level view of the information they exchange. It depicts the SMA and its primary data sharing partners in their current roles.

<span id="page-4-0"></span>![](_page_4_Picture_8.jpeg)

## **As-Is Context Diagram Description**

The Medicaid Enterprise As-Is Context Diagram depicts activity for the SMA that:

- Enrolls providers and contracts with Managed Care Organizations (MCO) and reimburses for services based on fees and rates.
- Receives eligibility information from sources of eligibility determination and CMS.
- Sends Medicaid benefit and service information and identification numbers to the beneficiary.
- Enrolls beneficiaries with MCO and Primary Care Physicians (PCP).
- Sends premiums payments to MCO, other payers, and CMS.
- Receives funds from CMS.
- Recovers payments from other payers and providers.
- Receives and pays claims.
- Receives encounter data from MCO.
- Responds to inquiries from providers, beneficiaries, other agencies, and CMS.

The As-Is Concept Diagram displays only the primary entities and the information they exchange (e.g., provider, beneficiary). In particular, it does not include business associates (e.g., fiscal agent, clearinghouse, enrollment broker, third party recovery contractor). Other interactions that occur between providers, beneficiaries, and other agencies external to the SMA may also impact the Medicaid Enterprise, e.g., one provider refers the beneficiary to another provider, or another agency administers a program that serves the Medicaid beneficiary.

In the As-Is operations, the most automated of the information exchanges are electronic claims and eligibility inquiries. Most of the other communications are still manual (paper posted to the United States Postal Service (USPS), facsimiles, telephone calls, and voice response). Some claims submissions, eligibility inquiries, and enrollment information exchanges now use Internet services. The retail pharmacy component of the health care delivery system is the exception. It has streamlined its operations through early adoption of electronic data interchange standards that include eligibility inquiry, service authorization, benefit coverage, and claim adjudication in a single, real-time session.

Health care delivery in the U.S. is a complex and loose structure composed of different providers, benefit plans, and payment mechanisms. It depends on timely and accurate exchange of clinical and administrative data. While the health care available in the U.S. is of the highest quality, the health care data exchange does not meet the same standards of excellence. For many years, the structure of health care information exchange in the U.S. is lacking, making information exchange quite unstructured, inefficient, slow, and mired in redundant paperwork and reporting. The Medicaid Enterprise provides leadership in solving the problems of information exchange but suffers from many of the inherent inefficiencies. For example, information about health status and outcomes is incomplete or absent, untimely, and inconsistent, which impedes the agency's ability to implement policies to prevent illness and treat disease effectively. Some reasons for this situation are:

![](_page_5_Picture_17.jpeg)

- Many provider offices and payers' files separately store information about an individual's health status and services received.
 To assemble even a small amount of this information into a consolidated profile of the beneficiary's health record, even if possible, is time-consuming, labor intensive, and costly, and the results expose widespread inconsistencies in the data collected.

 Limited and unstructured clinical information, which is the best data for health outcome studies, is untimely and expensive.

 Automated payment- related transactions are the primary source of data for health outcome studies; however, there are many other types of unstructured, untimely, and inefficient communication.

Other characteristics of the current Medicaid Enterprise are:

- Individuals find out about the Medicaid Program and apply for benefits at a limited number of special locations. This is inefficient and impedes access to assistance.
- There are numerous, uncoordinated benefit plans for which individuals may be eligible. This is highly inefficient and leads to "wrong care, wrong time, and wrong price". Beneficiaries will "follow the money", moving from program to program for services rather than having service plans established that optimize continuum of care.
- Individual providers cannot easily view the patient's clinical history from other providers, leading to patient safety issues and mismanagement of resources.
- Referrals are manual and stakeholders do not communicate in a timely manner, thereby impeding access to care.
- Patients randomly communicate compliance with the treatment plan to the provider because they have few avenues for participating in decisions regarding their own care and contributing to their personal health record.
- The Medicaid Program cannot make timely policy decisions or develop accurate budget projections because the data it accesses is untimely, non-standard, and incomplete. The primary source of data is claims-based transactions, which are a poor substitute for clinical data. Other beneficiary data required for policy analysis, such as demographic, employment, education, vital statistics, and criminal justice sources is difficult to assemble.

The COO shows further details regarding the As-Is Medicaid Enterprise following the To-Be Context Diagram in a series of comparisons of the current and future environments.

### **To-Be Context Diagram**

In the Medicaid Enterprise To-Be Context Diagram, **[Figure A-2](#page-7-0)**, the role of the business associates (e.g., fiscal agent, clearinghouse, enrollment broker) diminishes and disappears as the stakeholders implement changes. During the transition period, these associates will continue to support As-Is operations. Upon completion of the transformation, the stakeholders have optimized all administrative functions resulting in dramatic reduction in the allocation of resources to these operations. To-Be COO presented later in this document further illustrates this reduction in administrative burden.

*NOTE: Due to the regulation rule-making efforts underway at CMS, the MITA Framework 3.0 does not include the Eligibility & Enrollment (Member), the Member Management business processes or business capability matrices, and a portion of the Concept of Operations (COO) outlining the "to-be" for eligibility, enrollment, and insurance exchange information. CMS will update the MITA 3.0 Framework with appropriate information from the final rules in 2012.*

### **Definition of Primary Actors**

In the Medicaid Enterprise there are a small number of primary participants who exchange information critical to the operations and success of the program.

**[Table](#page-7-1) A-1** identifies the primary actors, describes their role in the As-Is operations, and highlights the changes that occur in the To-Be environment.

## **Medicaid Business Processes**

The enterprise COO provides a business description of how the overall enterprise and its major components operate. It also provides an overview of how data, applications, and technology support the business processes. The As-Is COO captures how the Medicaid Enterprise functions today based on commonalities between States. The To-Be COO is an expansion of the business vision of how the Medicaid Enterprise functions. The COO tells a story that describes the what, where, when, who, why, and how the business operates, primarily from a business or stakeholder's perspective.

### **As-Is Medicaid Business Processes**

The SMA operates the Medicaid program through an organizational structure of major business processes common to all States, although the individual state organization, the number and names of the business processes, and their detailed processes may differ. The MITA team has adopted the business process names used by the Systems Technical Advisory Group (S-TAG) in its redesign of the Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) to represent the generic Medicaid business processes: e.g., Member Management, Provider and Contract Management, Payment Management, Utilization and Quality Management, and Information Management. The MITA team added another business process, External Data Exchange, to illustrate the data sharing capabilities. **[Figure A-3](#page-16-0)** illustrates the major As-Is business processes.

**Figure A-3. Medicaid Enterprise As-Is Business Functions**

<span id="page-16-0"></span>**Member Management Business Functions** incorporates benefit plan administration, eligibility determination, enrollment, and disenrollment in programs, and beneficiary services business categories. It encompasses functions associated with: (1) the design of benefit plans and pricing, including waiver, Health Insurance Premium Payment (HIPP), Primary Care Case Manager (PCCM) and MCO; (2) the identification of the individuals covered by the benefit plans, definition of services provided; and (3) communication of this information. It does not include the direct provision of the service or information gathered about the services. Individual States may choose to separate Eligibility Determination, Eligibility Verification, Enrollment, and Benefit Administration into separate business areas.

**Provider and Contract Management Business Functions** groups business categories associated with contracts for provider participation, managed care, and any number of other services. Contracts may be for business associates who perform activities on behalf of the SMA, or for the direct delivery of services to the beneficiary population. This business area does not include the provision of service or the collection of information about the service.

![](_page_16_Picture_6.jpeg)

**Payment Management Business Functions** includes all business categories associated with determining payment, making payment, collecting receivables, and reporting for these functions. This business area includes encounters and claims. The SMA uses encounters and claims to determine capitation rates. With the implementation of the HIPAA Transaction and Code Set rule, encounter and claim transactions adhere to the same standards. States that have a primarily managed care program may choose to associate encounter claim functions with a MCO management business area. Some States may consider the Coordination of Benefits (COB) business area.

**Utilization and Quality Management Business Functions** is a business area that brings together various business categories that share common goals for compliance management, ensuring the quality of care received by beneficiaries and controlling costs. An individual state is free to link these functions with other business categories, e.g., Service Authorization and Prepayment Review with Payment Management.

**Information Management Business Functions** covers business categories associated with internal information maintenance, retrieval and reporting within the SMA.

**External Data Sharing and Exchange Business Functions** contains business categories to connect the SMA with CMS, public health agencies, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and any other potential data exchange partner that agrees to adopt the standards and criteria that each SMA specifies while adhering to MITA guidelines.

## **As-Is Concept of Operations**

**[Figure A-4](#page-18-0)** depicts the COO for the As-Is operations of the Medicaid Enterprise. It shows the interfaces between current Medicaid operations and the primary participants in the Medicaid Enterprise.

## **To-Be Medicaid Concept of Operations**

The transformations described in the To-Be Context Diagram lead to changes in the definition of To-Be business areas. The MITA team can project but not predetermine this future operational structure. The following is an organizational structure for the SMA of the future. These changes occur over time, and the agency evolves over several years. **[Figure](#page-19-0)  [A-5](#page-19-0)** depicts the Medicaid To-Be environment as it aligns with Medicaid vision and goals.

### **Comparison of As-Is and To-Be Concept of Operations**

Medicaid operations have evolved since its inception in 1965 through the Title XIX of the Social Security Act. Currently, the mature SMA is a complex organizational structure employing hundreds, sometimes thousands, of staff and outsourcing many functions. An array of business associates contract to support vital operations. Automation has been slow to come to the Medicaid operations. Eligibility inquiry, claims submission, and Point-of-Service (POS) claim adjudication are the most highly automated business processes; however, the widespread use of USPS, telephone, and facsimile services for provider enrollment, prior authorization, and payment processes contrasts As-Is and To-Be COO. As the Medicaid Enterprise matures with new standards and technologies applied, the To-Be environment reflects gained efficiencies and sharing of information at a time when authorized actors desire it. The following comparison illustrates how MITA modifies business operations based on the adaptations. Do not confuse the Member Management (ME) in the Comparison of As-Is and To-Be COO with the Member Management business area.

# **Medicaid Enterprise Mission and Goals**

The MITA Initiative starts with the Medicaid Enterprise mission and goals (see **[Table A-4](#page-26-0)**). These statements originate from surveys and interviews of State Medicaid Program directors, CMS division directors, industry leaders, and other federal agencies. It provides the foundation for the business-driven MITA Framework.

# **MITA Mission, Goals, and Objectives**

The MITA team developed the following mission, goals, and objectives statements in response to the Medicaid Enterprise mission and goals. Through the realization of these goals and objectives, MITA aids States in achieving their Medicaid mission and goals.

## **MITA Mission**

The mission is to establish a national framework of enabling technologies and processes that support improved program administration for the Medicaid Enterprise and for stakeholders dedicated to improving health care outcomes and administrative procedures for Medicaid beneficiaries.

## **MITA Goals**

The MITA Initiative seeks to accomplish the following goals:

- Develop seamless and integrated systems that communicate effectively to achieve common Medicaid goals through interoperability and common standards.
- Promote an environment that supports flexibility, adaptability, and rapid response to changes in programs and technology.
- Promote an enterprise view that supports enabling technologies that align with Medicaid business processes and technologies.

![](_page_26_Picture_15.jpeg)

- Provide data that is timely, accurate, usable, and easily accessible in order to support analysis and decision making for health care management and program administration.
- Provide performance measurement for accountability and planning.
- Coordinate with public health and other partners, and integrate health outcomes within the Medicaid community.

### **MITA Objectives**

The goals translate into the following objectives:

- Adopt industry standards for data exchange.
- Promote reusable components through standard interfaces and modularity.
- Promote efficient and effective data sharing to meet stakeholder needs.
- Provide a beneficiary-centric focus.
- Support interoperability, integration, and an open architecture.
- Promote secure data exchange (single entry point).
- Promote good practices (e.g., the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) and data warehouse).
- Support integration of clinical and administrative data to enable better decision making.
- Break down artificial boundaries between systems, geography, and funding (within the Title XIX Program).

The goals and objectives of the MITA Initiative further translate into the below Guiding Principles:

- Business-driven enterprise transformation.
- Accommodation of commonalities and difference between agencies.
- Standards applied to improve cost effectiveness.
- Built-in security and privacy capabilities.
- Data consistency across the enterprise.

# **Drivers and Enablers**

The improvements for the Medicaid Enterprise enabled by the convergence of enabling technologies and standards have reached a point of maturity after several years of evolution. The MITA Framework takes advantage of key Technical Architecture (TA) features for the SMA to mature to a secured, open and transparent enterprise.

The following series of **Tables A-5** through **A-9** expands on the concepts of technological design principles (drivers) and technological advancement (enablers) by providing business, operational and technical impact statements and concrete examples.

Adding<br>components from various vendors<br>is difficult because of these custom<br>interfaces.<br>Incompatible utility services create<br>system configuration problems that<br>impede optimal system use.<br>Migration of components to new<br>environments<br>is not easy.                                       | Utility services eliminate redundant<br>interchange handling. Standardized<br>interfaces connect applications and<br>facilitate addition of new components<br>from any vendor whose products<br>conform to these standards with less<br>risk, cost, and implementation time.<br>Applications can access data of<br>record at run-time reducing the need<br>for centralized data warehousing.<br>Uniform, compatible utility services<br>ensure ease of system configuration,<br>support plug-and-play capabilities,<br>and enable reuse of components.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Concrete Example                                                             | Systems have redundant and<br>incompatible security requirements.<br>Staff logs<br>in and out of each<br>application. There is no consistent<br>way for an application to<br>authenticate with<br>another system<br>that<br>requires interaction.<br>MMIS is typically a legacy system<br>that may have some integration<br>with other legacy systems via<br>custom point-to-point connections.<br>Enhancing functionality to support<br>new programs requires custom<br>coding to add a component. This<br>may require making multiple<br>modifications throughout the legacy<br>systems. These continual<br>modifications may lead to<br>unintended system conflicts and<br>loss of functionality. | Systems share security utility<br>services so that staff can access<br>them using one log-on and systems<br>authenticate<br>in a standard manner.<br>State Medicaid Enterprise<br>with SOA<br>is capable of enhancement because<br>the system makes use of little or no<br>knowledge of the definitions of other<br>separate components to connect<br>them (interfaces),<br>and organization of<br>common infrastructure support (utility<br>services) is<br>through a hub. This<br>means that States can quickly adapt<br>a component developed by another<br>state or purchase off-the-shelf<br>applications and integrate them<br>easily into their systems without<br>having to modify other system<br>components (i.e., plug-and-play<br>capabilities). |

## **Business Improvements**

The MITA team uses operational scenarios (case studies) to show the dynamics of the business operations from the stakeholders' point of view. The scenarios describe the what, where, when, why, and how of future SMA operations. Each scenario focuses on a specific area of interest that illustrates a major transformation to a business process that results in meeting specific MITA mission and objective statements.

### **Examples of Business Improvements**

To illustrate the progression from the As-Is operations to the To-Be environment, the MITA team has selected a number of examples of business improvements. Some of these are processes are already undergoing change today. They are selected from many possible examples of change because they help to illustrate the To-Be improvements and how the Medicaid Enterprise changes over time.

This chapter includes the following Business Improvements in this section:

- Enable "no wrong door"– Applicants for benefits find easy access to appropriate, coordinated services.
- Optimize health outcomes through conflict-free case management.
- Expand Flexibility and Adaptability (Benefit Plan Maintenance Example).
- Safeguard Public Health through collaboration.
- Improve health outcomes by empowering beneficiaries to participate in the management of their care.
- Improve accountability through use of Unique Provider Identifier and Standardized Provider Taxonomy.

| Each agency and each payer in every state has its own methodology<br>for enumerating providers and categorizing provider roles. The<br>different numbering schemes and nomenclatures impair consolidation<br>of provider profiles and comparison of provider activities. Research on<br>trends, patterns, and potential fraud is time-consuming and labor<br>intensive. It is very difficult to compare a provider's performance in the<br>Medicaid Program with the same provider's profile in Medicare,<br>managed care, and other payer programs. | The NPI standardizes provider identification throughout the United<br>States.<br>MITA and state collaboration promotes a standardized<br>taxonomy for all Medicaid providers across all States. States are able<br>to monitor provider performance, identify fraud, plan changes to<br>benefit programs;<br>budget for future needs, and clearly analyze<br>outcomes. |  |
