    "text": "3.1 As-Is – High Level Narrative\nCurrently, the Medicaid Enterprise contains several primary entities whose relationships and information exchanges have evolved since Medicaid’s inception in 1965 through the Title XIX of the Social Security Act. Major participants in the Medicaid Enterprise are: CMS, the SMA, sources of eligibility determination, providers, managed care organizations, beneficiaries, other agencies, and other payers. Title XIX of the Social Security Act created the national Medicaid Program to bring health care benefits to individuals meeting financial, age, and disability requirements. Federal funding matches state expenditures for approved benefits and administrative services. Each state, territory, and the District of Columbia (hereinafter referred to as the States) designate a single state agency to administer the program. The SMA pays providers, managed care organizations, benefit managers, and others to deliver a package of mandated and optional benefits to the covered population.\n\nThe primary influences on the Medicaid Enterprise are:\n\nFederal, state, and local legislation\nFederal and state health care initiatives\nProvider and consumer advocate demands\nCourt orders\nInfluence of the American health care delivery environment\nFunding\nVendor solutions\n\nThe Medicaid Enterprise is part of a loosely structured local and national health care infrastructure with which it shares providers, consumers, treatment protocols, data standards, health improvement objectives, public health reporting, and information.\nHealth care represents a significant percentage of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the United States; yet this business sector lags behind all other leading economic cost centers in the adoption of technology to improve its outcomes and manage its expenditures.",

    "text": "5.1 As-Is Context Diagram Description\nThe Medicaid Enterprise As-Is Context Diagram depicts activity for the SMA that:\n\nEnrolls providers and contracts with Managed Care Organizations (MCO) and reimburses for services based on fees and rates.\nReceives eligibility information from sources of eligibility determination and CMS.\nSends Medicaid benefit and service information and identification numbers to the beneficiary.\nEnrolls beneficiaries with MCO and Primary Care Physicians (PCP).\nSends premiums payments to MCO, other payers, and CMS.\nReceives funds from CMS.\nRecovers payments from other payers and providers.\nReceives and pays claims.\nReceives encounter data from MCO.\nResponds to inquiries from providers, beneficiaries, other agencies, and CMS.\n\nThe As-Is Concept Diagram displays only the primary entities and the information they exchange (e.g., provider, beneficiary). In particular, it does not include business associates (e.g., fiscal agent, clearinghouse, enrollment broker, third party recovery contractor). Other interactions that occur between providers, beneficiaries, and other agencies external to the SMA may also impact the Medicaid Enterprise, e.g., one provider refers the beneficiary to another provider, or another agency administers a program that serves the Medicaid beneficiary.\nIn the As-Is operations, the most automated of the information exchanges are electronic claims and eligibility inquiries. Most of the other communications are still manual (paper posted to the United States Postal Service (USPS), facsimiles, telephone calls, and voice response). Some claims submissions, eligibility inquiries, and enrollment information exchanges now use Internet services. The retail pharmacy component of the health care delivery system is the exception. It has streamlined its operations through early adoption of electronic data interchange standards that include eligibility inquiry, service authorization, benefit coverage, and claim adjudication in a single, real-time session.\nHealth care delivery in the U.S. is a complex and loose structure composed of different providers, benefit plans, and payment mechanisms. It depends on timely and accurate exchange of clinical and administrative data. While the health care available in the U.S. is of the highest quality, the health care data exchange does not meet the same standards of excellence. For many years, the structure of health care information exchange in the U.S. is lacking, making information exchange quite unstructured, inefficient, slow, and mired in redundant paperwork and reporting. The Medicaid Enterprise provides leadership in solving the problems of information exchange but suffers from many of the inherent inefficiencies. For example, information about health status and outcomes is incomplete or absent, untimely, and inconsistent, which impedes the agency’s ability to implement policies to prevent illness and treat disease effectively. Some reasons for this situation are:\n\n\nMany provider offices and payers’ files separately store information about an individual’s health status and services received. To assemble even a small amount of this information into a consolidated profile of the beneficiary’s health record, even if possible, is time-consuming, labor intensive, and costly, and the results expose widespread inconsistencies in the data collected.\n\nLimited and unstructured clinical information, which is the best data for health outcome studies, is untimely and expensive.\nAutomated payment- related transactions are the primary source of data for health outcome studies; however, there are many other types of unstructured, untimely, and inefficient communication.\nOther characteristics of the current Medicaid Enterprise are:\n\nIndividuals find out about the Medicaid Program and apply for benefits at a limited number of special locations. This is inefficient and impedes access to assistance.\nThere are numerous, uncoordinated benefit plans for which individuals may be eligible. This is highly inefficient and leads to “wrong care, wrong time, and wrong price”. Beneficiaries will “follow the money”, moving from program to program for services rather than having service plans established that optimize continuum of care.\nIndividual providers cannot easily view the patient’s clinical history from other providers, leading to patient safety issues and mismanagement of resources.\nReferrals are manual and stakeholders do not communicate in a timely manner, thereby impeding access to care.\nPatients randomly communicate compliance with the treatment plan to the provider because they have few avenues for participating in decisions regarding their own care and contributing to their personal health record.\nThe Medicaid Program cannot make timely policy decisions or develop accurate budget projections because the data it accesses is untimely, non-standard, and incomplete. The primary source of data is claims-based transactions, which are a poor substitute for clinical data. Other beneficiary data required for policy analysis, such as demographic, employment, education, vital statistics, and criminal justice sources is difficult to assemble.\n\nThe COO shows further details regarding the As-Is Medicaid Enterprise following the To-Be Context Diagram in a series of comparisons of the current and future environments.\n\n5.1.1 To-Be Context Diagram\nIn the Medicaid Enterprise To-Be Context Diagram, Figure A-2, the role of the business associates (e.g., fiscal agent, clearinghouse, enrollment broker) diminishes and disappears as the stakeholders implement changes. During the transition period, these associates will continue to support As-Is operations. Upon completion of the transformation, the stakeholders have optimized all administrative functions resulting in dramatic reduction in the allocation of resources to these operations. To-Be COO presented later in this document further illustrates this reduction in administrative burden.\n\nNOTE: Due to the regulation rule-making efforts underway at CMS, the MITA Framework 3.0 does not include the Eligibility & Enrollment (Member), the Member Management business processes or business capability matrices, and a portion of the Concept of Operations (COO) outlining the “to-be” for eligibility, enrollment, and insurance exchange information. CMS will update the MITA 3.0 Framework with appropriate information from the final rules in 2012.\n\n\n5.1.2 Figure A-2. Medicaid Enterprise To-Be Context Diagram",

    "text": "5.4 Medicaid Business Processes\nThe enterprise COO provides a business description of how the overall enterprise and its major components operate. It also provides an overview of how data, applications, and technology support the business processes. The As-Is COO captures how the Medicaid Enterprise functions today based on commonalities between States. The To-Be COO is an expansion of the business vision of how the Medicaid Enterprise functions. The COO tells a story that describes the what, where, when, who, why, and how the business operates, primarily from a business or stakeholder’s perspective.\n\n5.4.1 As-Is Medicaid Business Processes\nThe SMA operates the Medicaid program through an organizational structure of major business processes common to all States, although the individual state organization, the number and names of the business processes, and their detailed processes may differ. The MITA team has adopted the business process names used by the Systems Technical Advisory Group (S-TAG) in its redesign of the Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) to represent the generic Medicaid business processes: e.g., Member Management, Provider and Contract Management, Payment Management, Utilization and Quality Management, and Information Management. The MITA team added another business process, External Data Exchange, to illustrate the data sharing capabilities. Figure A-3 illustrates the major As-Is business processes.\n\n\nFigure A-3. Medicaid Enterprise As-Is Business Functions\nMember Management Business Functions incorporates benefit plan administration, eligibility determination, enrollment, and disenrollment in programs, and beneficiary services business categories. It encompasses functions associated with: (1) the design of benefit plans and pricing, including waiver, Health Insurance Premium Payment (HIPP), Primary Care Case Manager (PCCM) and MCO; (2) the identification of the individuals covered by the benefit plans, definition of services provided; and (3) communication of this information. It does not include the direct provision of the service or information gathered about the services. Individual States may choose to separate Eligibility Determination, Eligibility Verification, Enrollment, and Benefit Administration into separate business areas.\nProvider and Contract Management Business Functions groups business categories associated with contracts for provider participation, managed care, and any number of other services. Contracts may be for business associates who perform activities on behalf of the SMA, or for the direct delivery of services to the beneficiary population. This business area does not include the provision of service or the collection of information about the service.\n\nPayment Management Business Functions includes all business categories associated with determining payment, making payment, collecting receivables, and reporting for these functions. This business area includes encounters and claims. The SMA uses encounters and claims to determine capitation rates. With the implementation of the HIPAA Transaction and Code Set rule, encounter and claim transactions adhere to the same standards. States that have a primarily managed care program may choose to associate encounter claim functions with a MCO management business area. Some States may consider the Coordination of Benefits (COB) business area.\nUtilization and Quality Management Business Functions is a business area that brings together various business categories that share common goals for compliance management, ensuring the quality of care received by beneficiaries and controlling costs. An individual state is free to link these functions with other business categories, e.g., Service Authorization and Prepayment Review with Payment Management.\nInformation Management Business Functions covers business categories associated with internal information maintenance, retrieval and reporting within the SMA.\nExternal Data Sharing and Exchange Business Functions contains business categories to connect the SMA with CMS, public health agencies, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and any other potential data exchange partner that agrees to adopt the standards and criteria that each SMA specifies while adhering to MITA guidelines.",

    "text": "5.6 To-Be Medicaid Concept of Operations\nThe transformations described in the To-Be Context Diagram lead to changes in the definition of To-Be business areas. The MITA team can project but not predetermine this future operational structure. The following is an organizational structure for the SMA of the future. These changes occur over time, and the agency evolves over several years. Figure A-5 depicts the Medicaid To-Be environment as it aligns with Medicaid vision and goals.\n\n\n\n\n5.6.1 Comparison of As-Is and To-Be Concept of Operations\nMedicaid operations have evolved since its inception in 1965 through the Title XIX of the Social Security Act. Currently, the mature SMA is a complex organizational structure employing hundreds, sometimes thousands, of staff and outsourcing many functions. An array of business associates contract to support vital operations. Automation has been slow to come to the Medicaid operations. Eligibility inquiry, claims submission, and Point-of-Service (POS) claim adjudication are the most highly automated business processes; however, the widespread use of USPS, telephone, and facsimile services for provider enrollment, prior authorization, and payment processes contrasts As-Is and To-Be COO. As the Medicaid Enterprise matures with new standards and technologies applied, the To-Be environment reflects gained efficiencies and sharing of information at a time when authorized actors desire it. The following comparison illustrates how MITA modifies business operations based on the adaptations. Do not confuse the Member Management (ME) in the Comparison of As-Is and To-Be COO with the Member Management business area.\nTable A-3 describes the As-Is operations and the To-Be environment for the Medicaid Enterprise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison of As-Is and To-Be Concept of Operations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs-Is Operations\n\nTo-Be Environment\n\n\n\nMember Management (ME)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat ME operations do now:\n\nHow ME operations will change:\n\n\n\nEligibility sources determine eligibility andsend information to ME. ME sends benefitand identificationpackages to the beneficiary,helps select MCO enrollment, performs otherenrollments, answers questions, surveysquality of service, and hears complaints andappeals. ME maintains beneficiaryinformation. ME responds to inquiries reeligibility. ME may oversee case and diseasemanagement.ME operations focus on processingapplications, assigning beneficiaries toappropriate programs, assuring access tocare, promoting preventive care,communications with the beneficiary, andsurveying health status.\n\n\nME operations are less burdensomewith theeligibility and enrollment process because:\n\n\n\n\n\noApplicant appliesthrough Webportalusingstandardized and automatedprocesses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\noThe beneficiary participatesin choices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nME operations focus on analysis of programoutcomes:Are beneficiaries receiving bettercare?Are they more satisfied?Are health\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrends improving, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nME focuses on exception cases becausepatients have access to their own healthinformation viathe Health InformationExchange (HIE).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nME has accountability for health careimprovements for the population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.6.2 Table A-3.

    "text": "8.1 Business Improvements\nThe MITA team uses operational scenarios (case studies) to show the dynamics of the business operations from the stakeholders’ point of view. The scenarios describe the what, where, when, why, and how of future SMA operations. Each scenario focuses on a specific area of interest that illustrates a major transformation to a business process that results in meeting specific MITA mission and objective statements.\n\n8.1.1 Examples of Business Improvements\nTo illustrate the progression from the As-Is operations to the To-Be environment, the MITA team has selected a number of examples of business improvements. Some of these are processes are already undergoing change today. They are selected from many possible examples of change because they help to illustrate the To-Be improvements and how the Medicaid Enterprise changes over time.\nThis chapter includes the following Business Improvements in this section:\n\nEnable “no wrong door”– Applicants for benefits find easy access to appropriate, coordinated services.\nOptimize health outcomes through conflict-free case management.\nExpand Flexibility and Adaptability (Benefit Plan Maintenance Example).\nSafeguard Public Health through collaboration.\nImprove health outcomes by empowering beneficiaries to participate in the management of their care.\nImprove accountability through use of Unique Provider Identifier and Standardized Provider Taxonomy.\n\n\nTable A-10 through Table A-14 contain selected business cases to illustrate the transformations from the As-Is operations and the To-Be environment of a Medicaid Enterprise.\n\n8.1.1.1 Table A-10.

Storage and Access To Medical Records\na. Storage and Access to Electronic Health Records\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, beneficiary has medical records stored in multiple providerlocations. Much of the information in the multiple records is redundant,e.g., patient medical history, benefit coverage. Shares medicalinformation when requested by appropriateprovider, payer, auditor, orquality review organization;however, shared clinical information is nottimely,and the quality of the information varies widely. There are nodata standards;therefore,the information is inconsistent.

It aims to establish national guidance and best practice references for processes, data standards, and technologies that enhance program administration for State Medicaid Enterprises. Building upon the foundation of previous versions, MITA 4.0 supports the Medicaid mission and goals by facilitating integrated business and information technology transformations. This version refines, refocuses, and repurposes MITA to better align with the evolving needs of SMAs.\nMITA 4.0 introduces several new approaches to enhance its relevance and accessibility, with the goal of making it more meaningful for stakeholders while streamlining processes to reduce the burden on state agencies. The framework incorporates various state agency viewpoints to improve efficiency and better align with the Advanced Planning Document process, certification outcomes, and state agency acquisition processes. Additionally, MITA 4.0 provides guidance that reflects current healthcare and IT trends, ensuring that it remains at the forefront of technological advancements.\nBy focusing on these enhancements, MITA 4.0 ensures that technology decisions align with Medicaid business needs, optimizing adaptability, flexibility, interoperability, and data sharing. This evolution enables significant improvements in policy, decision-making, and daily operations, ultimately advancing the capabilities of State Medicaid Enterprises.",

    "text": "5.1 Purpose\nIn keeping with the guiding principle that MITA represents a business-driven enterprise transformation, the BA is the starting point of the MITA Framework. The BA describes the needs and goals of the individual State Medicaid Enterprise, and presents a collective vision of the future.\nThe BA will accomplish the following:\n\nEstablish a generic business framework for all States while recognizing their differences.\nDescribe how each state Medicaid Program can mature over a given period with the help of stakeholders, leadership, enabling legislation, and technology.\nProvide a baseline for the State Medicaid Agency (SMA) to assess their current business capabilities and measure progress toward improved capabilities.\n\n\n\n5.1.1 Scope\nThe BA focuses on the State Medicaid Enterprise that centers on the Medicaid environment including leveraged systems and interconnections among Medicaid stakeholders, providers, beneficiaries, insurance affordability programs (e.g., CHIP, tax credits, Basic Health Program), Health Insurance Exchange (HIX), Health Information Exchange (HIE), other state and local agencies, other payers, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), and other federal agencies. The MITA context defines the Medicaid Enterprise as:\n\nThe domain where federal matching funds apply.\nThe interfaces and bridges among Medicaid stakeholders, including providers, beneficiaries, other state and local agencies, other payers, CMS, and other federal agencies.\nThe sphere of influence touched by MITA (e.g., national and federal initiatives such as the Nationwide Health Information Network [NwHIN]). (See Front Matter, Chapter 6, Overview of the MITA Initiative, for a discussion of the Medicaid Enterprise.)\n\nEnterprise can have other meanings. For instance, Enterprise Architecture (EA) defines an enterprise-wide integrated set of components that incorporates strategic business thinking, information assets, and the technical infrastructure of an enterprise to promote information sharing across agency and organizational boundaries.\nThe BA acknowledges technology as one of several enablers that are important to growth and transformation, but it does not introduce technical implementations or solutions into the BA components. All technical references are found in Part III, Technical Architecture.\n\n\n5.1.2 Background\nStates, territories, and the District of Columbia (hereinafter referred to as States) are responsible for their individual State Medicaid Enterprise, and all entities are different in important ways. Differences include:\n\nOrganizational structure, covered programs, and lines of business\nBusiness rules, policies, and procedures affecting stakeholders\nRelationships with other state and local agencies\nRevenue sources\nLocation of business units\nWorkflow\nRange of outsourcing\nTechnical solutions\n\n\nThese entities also differ in their concept of an enterprise, the roles and responsibilities of one or more Chief Information Officers (CIO), adoption of data and technical standards, and the use of legacy versus state-of-the-art applications.\nGiven these differences, it is not possible or desirable, in the context of the MITA Framework, to develop a standalone business and technical model for each individual Medicaid Enterprise. Instead, MITA establishes a national framework of common processes and enabling technologies to support improved program administration in all States.\nThe BA focuses on areas of common ground (e.g., that all States will enroll providers and pay for services rendered to eligible beneficiaries and that all States seek to improve health care outcomes and improve administrative processes).\nThere is no ready-made methodology for building the MITA Framework to accommodate the business needs and transformation strategies of the States. To meet the special needs of MITA, the components included in the BA draw upon methodologies commonly in use today across industries as diverse as financial, transportation, and defense. The MITA team designed templates and models to help States identify and prioritize their specific business needs.\nThe BA section of the MITA Framework shows how MITA incorporates business-driven design to accomplish the following:\n\nSupport state needs.\n\no Align with state strategic goals.\no Align with state or Medicaid Agency enterprise architecture.\n\nSupport the CMS and common state goals.\n\no Align state approaches with MITA.\no Accommodate multi-state collaborative initiatives.\n\nSupport national goals through alignment with national initiatives, such as the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) and federal guidelines (e.g., Federal Health Architecture (FHA), the Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework (FEAF), and national/international data standards).",

The MMM adapts the industry model to the Medicaid Enterprise by describing Medicaid Program goals and objectives and the maturation of the MITA technical principles. The\ntransformation through each of the five (5) levels represents significant business capabilities advances over the previous period.\nThe MMM describes the five (5) levels of maturity and the measurable qualities that each level demonstrates. The general description is at a high enough level to apply to most aspects of State Medicaid Enterprise operations. For example, the MMM defines, at Level 1, the business area or process is in compliance with current regulations. At Level 2, the process matures because of pressures for cost containment and availability of newer tools. At Level 3, noticeable improvement occurs in the standardization and sharing of information\n\nand processes among multiple entities, including the beneficiary. At Level 4, instant availability of clinical information increases the transformation. By Level 5, States and local agencies have become interoperable across the United States.\nThe MMM is the point of reference for the BCM. The BCM aligns with the MMM to maintain consistency of definition. Part I, Chapter 3, Maturity Model, presents details of the MMM, and Part I, Appendix B, Maturity Model Details, contains the complete detailed text.\n\n7.2.1 Business Process Model\n\nThe BPM is a collection of common business processes for the operation of Medicaid Programs. A template describes those processes, including current and near-term operations as defined in Level 3 of the BCM. The MITA Framework BPM\nderives from multiple sources that create a common model that reflects most State Medicaid Enterprises – notable sources include the S-TAG Redesign of the Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS), and the CMS MHCCM, that consolidates business processes from a dozen States.\nStates should develop business workflows for the different business functions of the state to advance the alignment of the state’s capability maturity with the MMM. These business workflows should align to any provided by CMS in support of Medicaid and Exchange business operations and requirements. States should work to streamline and standardize these operational approaches and business workflows to minimize customization demands on technology solutions and optimize business outcomes.\nThere are those business processes that all States perform (e.g., Enroll Provider) and those that are voluntary and depend on implementation of special programs within a state (e.g., pay Managed Care Organization capitation or enrollment of member in a special program). The BPM defines common business practices across all State Medicaid Enterprises. The MITA Framework BPM offers a hierarchy of Tier 1 business areas, Tier 2 business categories and Tier 3 business processes. The MITA Framework contains ten (10) business areas divided into twenty-one (21) business categories with eighty (80) individual business processes. See Part I, Appendix C, Business Process Model Details.\nThe BPM provides a Business Process Template (BPT) for describing each business process. The BPT provides a summary of the business process, trigger event and result, activity steps, data requirements, predecessor and successor processes, failure points, and other elements. The NMEH workgroups review business processes, and they stand to benefit from ongoing review by state workgroups. See Part I, Chapter 4, Business Process Model, for a detailed presentation of the BPM and Part I, Appendix C, Business Process Model Details, for the complete set of business area definitions and business process descriptions.",

    "section": "3.1 Purpose",
    "text": "3.1 Purpose\nIn keeping with the guiding principle that MITA represents a business-driven enterprise transformation, the BA is the starting point of the MITA Framework. The BA describes the needs and goals of the individual State Medicaid Enterprise, and presents a collective vision of the future.\nThe BA will accomplish the following:\n\nEstablish a generic business framework for all States while recognizing their differences.\nDescribe how each state Medicaid Program can mature over a given period with the help of stakeholders, leadership, enabling legislation, and technology.\nProvide a baseline for the State Medicaid Agency (SMA) to assess their current business capabilities and measure progress toward improved capabilities.\n\n\n\n3.1.1 Scope\nThe BA focuses on the State Medicaid Enterprise that centers on the Medicaid environment including leveraged systems and interconnections among Medicaid stakeholders, providers, beneficiaries, insurance affordability programs (e.g., CHIP, tax credits, Basic Health Program), Health Insurance Exchange (HIX), Health Information Exchange (HIE), other state and local agencies, other payers, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), and other federal agencies. The MITA context defines the Medicaid Enterprise as:\n\nThe domain where federal matching funds apply.\nThe interfaces and bridges among Medicaid stakeholders, including providers, beneficiaries, other state and local agencies, other payers, CMS, and other federal agencies.\nThe sphere of influence touched by MITA (e.g., national and federal initiatives such as the Nationwide Health Information Network [NwHIN]). (See Front Matter, Chapter 6, Overview of the MITA Initiative, for a discussion of the Medicaid Enterprise.)\n\nEnterprise can have other meanings. For instance, Enterprise Architecture (EA) defines an enterprise-wide integrated set of components that incorporates strategic business thinking, information assets, and the technical infrastructure of an enterprise to promote information sharing across agency and organizational boundaries.\nThe BA acknowledges technology as one of several enablers that are important to growth and transformation, but it does not introduce technical implementations or solutions into the BA components. All technical references are found in Part III, Technical Architecture.\n\n\n3.1.2 Background\nStates, territories, and the District of Columbia (hereinafter referred to as States) are responsible for their individual State Medicaid Enterprise, and all entities are different in important ways. Differences include:\n\nOrganizational structure, covered programs, and lines of business\nBusiness rules, policies, and procedures affecting stakeholders\nRelationships with other state and local agencies\nRevenue sources\nLocation of business units\nWorkflow\nRange of outsourcing\nTechnical solutions\n\n\nThese entities also differ in their concept of an enterprise, the roles and responsibilities of one or more Chief Information Officers (CIO), adoption of data and technical standards, and the use of legacy versus state-of-the-art applications.\nGiven these differences, it is not possible or desirable, in the context of the MITA Framework, to develop a standalone business and technical model for each individual Medicaid Enterprise. Instead, MITA establishes a national framework of common processes and enabling technologies to support improved program administration in all States.\nThe BA focuses on areas of common ground (e.g., that all States will enroll providers and pay for services rendered to eligible beneficiaries and that all States seek to improve health care outcomes and improve administrative processes).\nThere is no ready-made methodology for building the MITA Framework to accommodate the business needs and transformation strategies of the States. To meet the special needs of MITA, the components included in the BA draw upon methodologies commonly in use today across industries as diverse as financial, transportation, and defense. The MITA team designed templates and models to help States identify and prioritize their specific business needs.\nThe BA section of the MITA Framework shows how MITA incorporates business-driven design to accomplish the following:\n\nSupport state needs.\n\no Align with state strategic goals.\no Align with state or Medicaid Agency enterprise architecture.\n\nSupport the CMS and common state goals.\n\no Align state approaches with MITA.\no Accommodate multi-state collaborative initiatives.\n\nSupport national goals through alignment with national initiatives, such as the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) and federal guidelines (e.g., Federal Health Architecture (FHA), the Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework (FEAF), and national/international data standards).",

The Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) is a mechanized claims processing and information retrieval system used by the States for Title XIX of the Social Security Act (The Act); therefore, the guidance set forth in CMS 42 CFR Part 433 applies to the MMIS as well as the Medicaid eligibility determination and enrollment activities as set forth in the Affordable Care Act of 2010.\nCMS expects States to meet the standards and conditions specified in §433.112(b)(10) through §433.112(b)(16). The standards and conditions are descriptive in nature; however, CMS recognizes that in order for the States to meet these standards and conditions it is necessary to provide additional guidance that clearly articulates its criteria for meeting them\n\nin terms of timeliness, accuracy, efficiency, integrity, and performance standards for mechanized claims processing. In response to this need, additional guidance materials include:\n\nEnhanced Funding Requirements: Seven Conditions and Standards (a.k.a. Seven Standards and Conditions)\nGuidance for Exchange and Medicaid Information Technology (IT) Systems (a.k.a. IT Guidance)\n\nCMS will continue to refine, update and expand this guidance in the future, based on feedback from stakeholders and with experience over time.",

Other industries (e.g., the Department of Defense (DOD) or National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)) use the COO as a strategic-planning device to capture the As-Is (i.e., current) operations,\ncreate the To-Be (i.e., future) environment, and level-set expectations before engaging in major transformation projects. The COO provides a structure to place information gathered from interviews with States and visioning sessions conducted at MMIS conferences. The COO structure provides key information including:\n\nDefinition of the scope of the Medicaid Enterprise.\nDescription of the As-Is (current) operations in terms of business, architecture, and data.\nDescription of the drivers and enablers that propel and support transformation.\nDescription of the To-Be environment in terms of business, architecture, and data.\nDescription of operational scenarios with sequence of events and activities carried out by stakeholders and the State Medicaid Enterprise.\nDescription of the impacts on each stakeholder.\nDescription of a summary of the improvements to the State Medicaid Enterprise and stakeholders.\n\nThe goal of the COO is to project changes, transformations, and provide visions of To-Be operations, new roles and data exchanges for stakeholders. The MITA COO provides a common vision shared by CMS and the States that preserves individual adaptations at the state level.\nPart I, Chapter 2, Concept of Operations, provides more information on the Medicaid Enterprise COO. Part I, Appendix A, Concept of Operations Details, contains additional information.",

    "text": "5.2 MITA Maturity Model\n\nThe MMM originates from industries that use such models to illustrate how a business can mature. The MMM adapts the industry model to the Medicaid Enterprise by describing Medicaid Program goals and objectives and the maturation of the MITA technical principles. The\ntransformation through each of the five (5) levels represents significant business capabilities advances over the previous period.\nThe MMM describes the five (5) levels of maturity and the measurable qualities that each level demonstrates. The general description is at a high enough level to apply to most aspects of State Medicaid Enterprise operations. For example, the MMM defines, at Level 1, the business area or process is in compliance with current regulations. At Level 2, the process matures because of pressures for cost containment and availability of newer tools. At Level 3, noticeable improvement occurs in the standardization and sharing of information\n\nand processes among multiple entities, including the beneficiary. At Level 4, instant availability of clinical information increases the transformation. By Level 5, States and local agencies have become interoperable across the United States.\nThe MMM is the point of reference for the BCM. The BCM aligns with the MMM to maintain consistency of definition. Part I, Chapter 3, Maturity Model, presents details of the MMM, and Part I, Appendix B, Maturity Model Details, contains the complete detailed text.\n\n5.2.1 Business Process Model\n\nThe BPM is a collection of common business processes for the operation of Medicaid Programs. A template describes those processes, including current and near-term operations as defined in Level 3 of the BCM. The MITA Framework BPM\nderives from multiple sources that create a common model that reflects most State Medicaid Enterprises – notable sources include the S-TAG Redesign of the Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS), and the CMS MHCCM, that consolidates business processes from a dozen States.\nStates should develop business workflows for the different business functions of the state to advance the alignment of the state’s capability maturity with the MMM. These business workflows should align to any provided by CMS in support of Medicaid and Exchange business operations and requirements. States should work to streamline and standardize these operational approaches and business workflows to minimize customization demands on technology solutions and optimize business outcomes.\nThere are those business processes that all States perform (e.g., Enroll Provider) and those that are voluntary and depend on implementation of special programs within a state (e.g., pay Managed Care Organization capitation or enrollment of member in a special program). The BPM defines common business practices across all State Medicaid Enterprises. The MITA Framework BPM offers a hierarchy of Tier 1 business areas, Tier 2 business categories and Tier 3 business processes. The MITA Framework contains ten (10) business areas divided into twenty-one (21) business categories with eighty (80) individual business processes. See Part I, Appendix C, Business Process Model Details.\nThe BPM provides a Business Process Template (BPT) for describing each business process. The BPT provides a summary of the business process, trigger event and result, activity steps, data requirements, predecessor and successor processes, failure points, and other elements. The NMEH workgroups review business processes, and they stand to benefit from ongoing review by state workgroups. See Part I, Chapter 4, Business Process Model, for a detailed presentation of the BPM and Part I, Appendix C, Business Process Model Details, for the complete set of business area definitions and business process descriptions.",

The BCM defines six (6) business capabilities with five (5) levels of maturity to each business process. The BCM assigns capabilities to an individual business process rather than to SMA operations taken as a whole. In reality, no SMA is “all Level 1” or “all Level 2,” but rather having\na blend of different levels of capability.

    "section": "Purpose",
    "text": "Purpose\nIn keeping with the guiding principle that MITA represents a business-driven enterprise transformation, the BA is the starting point of the MITA Framework. The BA describes the needs and goals of the individual State Medicaid Enterprise, and presents a collective vision of the future.\nThe BA will accomplish the following:\n\nEstablish a generic business framework for all States while recognizing their differences.\nDescribe how each state Medicaid Program can mature over a given period with the help of stakeholders, leadership, enabling legislation, and technology.\nProvide a baseline for the State Medicaid Agency (SMA) to assess their current business capabilities and measure progress toward improved capabilities.\n\n\n\nScope\nThe BA focuses on the State Medicaid Enterprise that centers on the Medicaid environment including leveraged systems and interconnections among Medicaid stakeholders, providers, beneficiaries, insurance affordability programs (e.g., CHIP, tax credits, Basic Health Program), Health Insurance Exchange (HIX), Health Information Exchange (HIE), other state and local agencies, other payers, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), and other federal agencies. The MITA context defines the Medicaid Enterprise as:\n\nThe domain where federal matching funds apply.\nThe interfaces and bridges among Medicaid stakeholders, including providers, beneficiaries, other state and local agencies, other payers, CMS, and other federal agencies.\nThe sphere of influence touched by MITA (e.g., national and federal initiatives such as the Nationwide Health Information Network [NwHIN]). (See Front Matter, Chapter 6, Overview of the MITA Initiative, for a discussion of the Medicaid Enterprise.)\n\nEnterprise can have other meanings. For instance, Enterprise Architecture (EA) defines an enterprise-wide integrated set of components that incorporates strategic business thinking, information assets, and the technical infrastructure of an enterprise to promote information sharing across agency and organizational boundaries.\nThe BA acknowledges technology as one of several enablers that are important to growth and transformation, but it does not introduce technical implementations or solutions into the BA components. All technical references are found in Part III, Technical Architecture.\n\n\nBackground\nStates, territories, and the District of Columbia (hereinafter referred to as States) are responsible for their individual State Medicaid Enterprise, and all entities are different in important ways. Differences include:\n\nOrganizational structure, covered programs, and lines of business\nBusiness rules, policies, and procedures affecting stakeholders\nRelationships with other state and local agencies\nRevenue sources\nLocation of business units\nWorkflow\nRange of outsourcing\nTechnical solutions\n\n\nThese entities also differ in their concept of an enterprise, the roles and responsibilities of one or more Chief Information Officers (CIO), adoption of data and technical standards, and the use of legacy versus state-of-the-art applications.\nGiven these differences, it is not possible or desirable, in the context of the MITA Framework, to develop a standalone business and technical model for each individual Medicaid Enterprise. Instead, MITA establishes a national framework of common processes and enabling technologies to support improved program administration in all States.\nThe BA focuses on areas of common ground (e.g., that all States will enroll providers and pay for services rendered to eligible beneficiaries and that all States seek to improve health care outcomes and improve administrative processes).\nThere is no ready-made methodology for building the MITA Framework to accommodate the business needs and transformation strategies of the States. To meet the special needs of MITA, the components included in the BA draw upon methodologies commonly in use today across industries as diverse as financial, transportation, and defense. The MITA team designed templates and models to help States identify and prioritize their specific business needs.\nThe BA section of the MITA Framework shows how MITA incorporates business-driven design to accomplish the following:\n\nSupport state needs.\n\no Align with state strategic goals.\no Align with state or Medicaid Agency enterprise architecture.\n\nSupport the CMS and common state goals.\n\no Align state approaches with MITA.\no Accommodate multi-state collaborative initiatives.\n\nSupport national goals through alignment with national initiatives, such as the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) and federal guidelines (e.g., Federal Health Architecture (FHA), the Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework (FEAF), and national/international data standards).",

The Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) is a mechanized claims processing and information retrieval system used by the States for Title XIX of the Social Security Act (The Act); therefore, the guidance set forth in CMS 42 CFR Part 433 applies to the MMIS as well as the Medicaid eligibility determination and enrollment activities as set forth in the Affordable Care Act of 2010.\nCMS expects States to meet the standards and conditions specified in §433.112(b)(10) through §433.112(b)(16). The standards and conditions are descriptive in nature; however, CMS recognizes that in order for the States to meet these standards and conditions it is necessary to provide additional guidance that clearly articulates its criteria for meeting them\n\nin terms of timeliness, accuracy, efficiency, integrity, and performance standards for mechanized claims processing. In response to this need, additional guidance materials include:\n\nEnhanced Funding Requirements: Seven Conditions and Standards (a.k.a. Seven Standards and Conditions)\nGuidance for Exchange and Medicaid Information Technology (IT) Systems (a.k.a. IT Guidance)\n\nCMS will continue to refine, update and expand this guidance in the future, based on feedback from stakeholders and with experience over time.",

    "text": "MITA Maturity Model\n\nThe MMM originates from industries that use such models to illustrate how a business can mature. The MMM adapts the industry model to the Medicaid Enterprise by describing Medicaid Program goals and objectives and the maturation of the MITA technical principles. The\ntransformation through each of the five (5) levels represents significant business capabilities advances over the previous period.\nThe MMM describes the five (5) levels of maturity and the measurable qualities that each level demonstrates. The general description is at a high enough level to apply to most aspects of State Medicaid Enterprise operations. For example, the MMM defines, at Level 1, the business area or process is in compliance with current regulations. At Level 2, the process matures because of pressures for cost containment and availability of newer tools. At Level 3, noticeable improvement occurs in the standardization and sharing of information\n\nand processes among multiple entities, including the beneficiary. At Level 4, instant availability of clinical information increases the transformation. By Level 5, States and local agencies have become interoperable across the United States.\nThe MMM is the point of reference for the BCM. The BCM aligns with the MMM to maintain consistency of definition. Part I, Chapter 3, Maturity Model, presents details of the MMM, and Part I, Appendix B, Maturity Model Details, contains the complete detailed text.\n\nBusiness Process Model\n\nThe BPM is a collection of common business processes for the operation of Medicaid Programs. A template describes those processes, including current and near-term operations as defined in Level 3 of the BCM. The MITA Framework BPM\nderives from multiple sources that create a common model that reflects most State Medicaid Enterprises – notable sources include the S-TAG Redesign of the Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS), and the CMS MHCCM, that consolidates business processes from a dozen States.\nStates should develop business workflows for the different business functions of the state to advance the alignment of the state’s capability maturity with the MMM. These business workflows should align to any provided by CMS in support of Medicaid and Exchange business operations and requirements. States should work to streamline and standardize these operational approaches and business workflows to minimize customization demands on technology solutions and optimize business outcomes.\nThere are those business processes that all States perform (e.g., Enroll Provider) and those that are voluntary and depend on implementation of special programs within a state (e.g., pay Managed Care Organization capitation or enrollment of member in a special program). The BPM defines common business practices across all State Medicaid Enterprises. The MITA Framework BPM offers a hierarchy of Tier 1 business areas, Tier 2 business categories and Tier 3 business processes. The MITA Framework contains ten (10) business areas divided into twenty-one (21) business categories with eighty (80) individual business processes. See Part I, Appendix C, Business Process Model Details.\nThe BPM provides a Business Process Template (BPT) for describing each business process. The BPT provides a summary of the business process, trigger event and result, activity steps, data requirements, predecessor and successor processes, failure points, and other elements. The NMEH workgroups review business processes, and they stand to benefit from ongoing review by state workgroups. See Part I, Chapter 4, Business Process Model, for a detailed presentation of the BPM and Part I, Appendix C, Business Process Model Details, for the complete set of business area definitions and business process descriptions.",

The BCM defines six (6) business capabilities with five (5) levels of maturity to each business process. The BCM assigns capabilities to an individual business process rather than to SMA operations taken as a whole. In reality, no SMA is “all Level 1” or “all Level 2,” but rather having\na blend of different levels of capability. An example of the relationship among the business process, the MMM, and the BCM is shown in Table 1-3.\nPart I, Chapter 5, Business Capability Matrix, presents more information on the BCM and Part I, Appendix D, Business Capability Matrix Details, lists the capabilities defined for business processes contained in MITA Framework.\n\nTable 1-3.

Definition of a MITA Capability ### Introduction\n\nIn business architecture, a “capability” is a key concept that represents what an organization can achieve. Think of a capability as the set of skills and resources a musician needs to perform a symphony. Just like a musician requires sheet music, instruments, and practice, an organization needs specific capabilities to deliver its services effectively.\nThe idea of a capability comes from the TOGAF framework, a well-known standard in enterprise architecture. TOGAF defines a capability as something a business can do or aims to develop to meet its goals. This focuses on “what” a business can achieve, rather than “how” it does it.\nFor State Medicaid Agencies (SMAs), understanding and using the MITA Capability Model is important. This model provides a structured way to identify and improve the capabilities needed for efficient Medicaid operations. By focusing on capabilities, SMAs can better align their resources and processes with strategic goals, ultimately improving service delivery and outcomes for beneficiaries.\n\n8.1.0.1 Purpose\nTo build the MITA 4.0 NextGen Business Architecture and show its relationship to other architectures, we suggest focusing on two to three core components: Business Capabilities (the What), Business Processes (the How), and possibly, Value Streams (the Why). MITA 3.0 mainly focused on business processes through its Business Process Model (BPM). Business capabilities and value streams will be new and need development and definition to be useful in MITA 4.0.\nMITA 3.0 included a version of business capabilities that was different from other major architecture frameworks. Instead of being a separate component, MITA 3.0 defined capabilities through a matrix of processes and maturity (i.e., a capability was seen as a business process at a specific level of maturity). Based on recommendations to change the BPM, we propose aligning MITA 4.0 business architecture more closely with the TOGAF standard, where capabilities are separate but related components. To guide this change, we propose the following definition/description of business capabilities, based on the TOGAF definition and paraphrased below.\nBy adopting this refined approach to capabilities, SMAs can streamline their operations and be better prepared to adapt to future challenges and opportunities in the healthcare landscape.\n\nB.

TOGAF defines a capability as something a business can do or aims to develop to meet its goals. This focuses on “what” a business can achieve, rather than “how” it does it.\nFor State Medicaid Agencies (SMAs), using MITA 4.0 Framework understanding its Capability Model is important. This model provides a structured way to identify and improve the capabilities needed for efficient Medicaid operations. By focusing on capabilities, SMAs can better align their resources and processes with strategic goals, ultimately improving their insight into their Medicaid Enterprize Architecture.\nPurpose and Update to MITA 3.0\nTo build the MITA 4.0 NextGen Business Architecture and show its relationship to the Information and Technical architectures, we suggest focusing on two to three core components: Business Capabilities (the What), Business Processes (the How), and possibly, Value Streams (the Why). MITA 3.0 mainly focused on business processes through its Business Process Model (BPM). Business capabilities and value streams will be new and need development and definition to be useful in MITA 4.0.\nMITA 3.0 included a version of business capabilities that was different from other major architecture frameworks. Instead of being a separate component, MITA 3.0 defined capabilities through a matrix of processes and maturity (i.e., a capability was seen as a business process at a specific level of maturity). This required MITA 3.0 users to evaluate the maturity of a large set of Based on recommendations to change the BPM, we propose aligning MITA 4.0 business architecture more closely with other more widely used models where capabilities are separate but related components. To guide this change, we propose the following definition/description of business capabilities, based on the TOGAF definition and paraphrased below.\nBy adopting this refined approach to capabilities, SMAs can streamline their operations and be better prepared to adapt to future challenges and opportunities in the healthcare landscape.\n\n\nKey Components of a MITA Capability\nThe MITA Definition of a Capability Business capabilities are high-level, broad concepts that focus on what the business does, rather than how it operates. Examples include care management or policy development. This perspective allows for business planning from different viewpoints, facilitating strategic alignment and operational efficiency.\nWithin the context of MITA, a “capability” is defined as the ability or capacity of a State Medicaid Agency (SMA) to achieve a specific desired outcome. A capability may currently exist in an operational state or be envisioned for future development. Through careful planning, capabilities can be matured and refined over time to become more effective and efficient. They can be organized and detailed at various levels of abstraction, providing precise descriptions for operational purposes or more generalized views for strategic planning.\nTo fully define a business capability, it is essential to understand how it is realized through the integration of people, processes, information, and resources. While these elements can change regularly, the capability itself is designed to endure over longer planning horizons, supporting the achievement of increasingly ambitious outcomes.\n\n\nBusiness Roles Business roles represent individual actors, stakeholders, or partners involved in delivering a business capability. A single organizational group or team may be wholly responsible for delivering the capability, or multiple business entities may share the delivery of a particular business capability. Business Roles perform Business Processes using Technology Resources.\nBusiness Processes Individual business capabilities may be enabled or delivered through a range of business processes that detail the activities (the how) associated with delivering the capability. Identifying and analyzing the efficiency of the underlying processes helps to optimize the business capability’s effectiveness. Identifying the processes within a business capability provides a focus for maturing the capability in concert with the other capability components. Business Processes operationalize Business Capabilities.\nInformation/Data Information/data represents the business data, knowledge, and insight required or consumed by the business capability (as distinct from IT-related data entities). It may also include information that the capability exchanges with other capabilities to support the execution of value streams. Examples include information about customers and prospects, products and services, business policies and rules, sales reports, and performance metrics. Information/data inform the Business Capability, answering questions and supporting business rules.\nTechnology Resources Business capabilities rely on a range of tools, applications, systems, and services for successful execution. Technology Resources use Information/data to facilitate Business Processes. Such resources may include:\n\nModular software applications\nCloud or on-premise infrastructure\nMicroservices\nAnalytics\nCustomer portal",

    "text": "Purpose\nIn keeping with the guiding principle that MITA represents a business-driven enterprise transformation, the BA is the starting point of the MITA Framework. The BA describes the needs and goals of the individual State Medicaid Enterprise, and presents a collective vision of the future.\nThe BA will accomplish the following:\n\nEstablish a generic business framework for all States while recognizing their differences.\nDescribe how each state Medicaid Program can mature over a given period with the help of stakeholders, leadership, enabling legislation, and technology.\nProvide a baseline for the State Medicaid Agency (SMA) to assess their current business capabilities and measure progress toward improved capabilities.\n\n\n\nScope\nThe BA focuses on the State Medicaid Enterprise that centers on the Medicaid environment including leveraged systems and interconnections among Medicaid stakeholders, providers, beneficiaries, insurance affordability programs (e.g., CHIP, tax credits, Basic Health Program), Health Insurance Exchange (HIX), Health Information Exchange (HIE), other state and local agencies, other payers, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), and other federal agencies. The MITA context defines the Medicaid Enterprise as:\n\nThe domain where federal matching funds apply.\nThe interfaces and bridges among Medicaid stakeholders, including providers, beneficiaries, other state and local agencies, other payers, CMS, and other federal agencies.\nThe sphere of influence touched by MITA (e.g., national and federal initiatives such as the Nationwide Health Information Network [NwHIN]). (See Front Matter, Chapter 6, Overview of the MITA Initiative, for a discussion of the Medicaid Enterprise.)\n\nEnterprise can have other meanings. For instance, Enterprise Architecture (EA) defines an enterprise-wide integrated set of components that incorporates strategic business thinking, information assets, and the technical infrastructure of an enterprise to promote information sharing across agency and organizational boundaries.\nThe BA acknowledges technology as one of several enablers that are important to growth and transformation, but it does not introduce technical implementations or solutions into the BA components. All technical references are found in Part III, Technical Architecture.\n\n\nBackground\nStates, territories, and the District of Columbia (hereinafter referred to as States) are responsible for their individual State Medicaid Enterprise, and all entities are different in important ways. Differences include:\n\nOrganizational structure, covered programs, and lines of business\nBusiness rules, policies, and procedures affecting stakeholders\nRelationships with other state and local agencies\nRevenue sources\nLocation of business units\nWorkflow\nRange of outsourcing\nTechnical solutions\n\n\nThese entities also differ in their concept of an enterprise, the roles and responsibilities of one or more Chief Information Officers (CIO), adoption of data and technical standards, and the use of legacy versus state-of-the-art applications.\nGiven these differences, it is not possible or desirable, in the context of the MITA Framework, to develop a standalone business and technical model for each individual Medicaid Enterprise. Instead, MITA establishes a national framework of common processes and enabling technologies to support improved program administration in all States.\nThe BA focuses on areas of common ground (e.g., that all States will enroll providers and pay for services rendered to eligible beneficiaries and that all States seek to improve health care outcomes and improve administrative processes).\nThere is no ready-made methodology for building the MITA Framework to accommodate the business needs and transformation strategies of the States. To meet the special needs of MITA, the components included in the BA draw upon methodologies commonly in use today across industries as diverse as financial, transportation, and defense. The MITA team designed templates and models to help States identify and prioritize their specific business needs.\nThe BA section of the MITA Framework shows how MITA incorporates business-driven design to accomplish the following:\n\nSupport state needs.\n\no Align with state strategic goals.\no Align with state or Medicaid Agency enterprise architecture.\n\nSupport the CMS and common state goals.\n\no Align state approaches with MITA.\no Accommodate multi-state collaborative initiatives.\n\nSupport national goals through alignment with national initiatives, such as the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) and federal guidelines (e.g., Federal Health Architecture (FHA), the Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework (FEAF), and national/international data standards).",

The MMM adapts the industry model to the Medicaid Enterprise by describing Medicaid Program goals and objectives and the maturation of the MITA technical principles. The\ntransformation through each of the five (5) levels represents significant business capabilities advances over the previous period.\nThe MMM describes the five (5) levels of maturity and the measurable qualities that each level demonstrates. The general description is at a high enough level to apply to most aspects of State Medicaid Enterprise operations. For example, the MMM defines, at Level 1, the business area or process is in compliance with current regulations. At Level 2, the process matures because of pressures for cost containment and availability of newer tools. At Level 3, noticeable improvement occurs in the standardization and sharing of information\n\nand processes among multiple entities, including the beneficiary. At Level 4, instant availability of clinical information increases the transformation. By Level 5, States and local agencies have become interoperable across the United States.\nThe MMM is the point of reference for the BCM. The BCM aligns with the MMM to maintain consistency of definition. Part I, Chapter 3, Maturity Model, presents details of the MMM, and Part I, Appendix B, Maturity Model Details, contains the complete detailed text.\n\nBusiness Process Model\n\nThe BPM is a collection of common business processes for the operation of Medicaid Programs. A template describes those processes, including current and near-term operations as defined in Level 3 of the BCM. The MITA Framework BPM\nderives from multiple sources that create a common model that reflects most State Medicaid Enterprises – notable sources include the S-TAG Redesign of the Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS), and the CMS MHCCM, that consolidates business processes from a dozen States.\nStates should develop business workflows for the different business functions of the state to advance the alignment of the state’s capability maturity with the MMM. These business workflows should align to any provided by CMS in support of Medicaid and Exchange business operations and requirements. States should work to streamline and standardize these operational approaches and business workflows to minimize customization demands on technology solutions and optimize business outcomes.\nThere are those business processes that all States perform (e.g., Enroll Provider) and those that are voluntary and depend on implementation of special programs within a state (e.g., pay Managed Care Organization capitation or enrollment of member in a special program). The BPM defines common business practices across all State Medicaid Enterprises. The MITA Framework BPM offers a hierarchy of Tier 1 business areas, Tier 2 business categories and Tier 3 business processes. The MITA Framework contains ten (10) business areas divided into twenty-one (21) business categories with eighty (80) individual business processes. See Part I, Appendix C, Business Process Model Details.\nThe BPM provides a Business Process Template (BPT) for describing each business process. The BPT provides a summary of the business process, trigger event and result, activity steps, data requirements, predecessor and successor processes, failure points, and other elements. The NMEH workgroups review business processes, and they stand to benefit from ongoing review by state workgroups. See Part I, Chapter 4, Business Process Model, for a detailed presentation of the BPM and Part I, Appendix C, Business Process Model Details, for the complete set of business area definitions and business process descriptions.",

These principles ensure that MITA 4.0 remains a relevant and valuable tool for State Medicaid Agencies and their stakeholders.\nBusiness-Driven Transformation: Define business transformations with a focus on aligning IT solutions with both common and unique state needs. This principle ensures that technology initiatives are directly informed by business objectives, leading to more effective and tailored solutions.\nStandards First: Promote data and technical standards to improve IT development cost-effectiveness. By prioritizing standards, we aim to streamline processes and reduce complexity, ultimately enhancing interoperability and efficiency.\nDefine Clear Linkages Between Capabilities and Outcomes: Establish clear definitions for both MITA Capabilities and Outcomes, and articulate the relationship between them and the MITA architectures. This principle ensures that every capability is directly aligned with desired outcomes, linking strategic objectives with operational execution in a coherent framework.\nReduce Burden on SMAs: Simplify processes and requirements to alleviate the administrative load on State Medicaid Agencies, enabling them to focus more on service delivery and less on compliance.\nEnable Automation: Encourage the adoption of automated processes to increase efficiency and accuracy in Medicaid operations, reducing manual intervention and the potential for errors.\nRelease Guidance Aligned with Current Trends: Provide guidance that reflects the latest trends in healthcare and IT, ensuring that MITA 4.0 remains relevant and forward-looking in its approach to Medicaid management.\nIntegrate with Other Activities: Enhance the integration of MITA with related activities such as APD development, Certification, T-MSIS reporting, and state procurement processes. This principle aims to create a cohesive framework that supports comprehensive Medicaid management and aligns with broader state and federal initiatives.\nTransition to a Web-Enabled Presentation: Move from the static, PDF-based MITA 3.0 to a dynamic, web-enabled format. This principle facilitates easier maintenance and continuous improvement by the community, allowing for real-time updates and enabling stakeholders to access the most current information. By fostering a collaborative environment, we encourage the sharing of insights and innovations, making MITA a more robust and adaptable framework for all users.\nThese principles are foundational to the development and implementation of MITA 4.0, ensuring it effectively supports the evolving needs of Medicaid operations.",
